# Lab-4-Using-Web-APIs
This repository will house everything needed for CSCI 2910 Lab 4.

## Issues

1. Open Trivia Database API has 25 categories, so displaying category options to the user will be a bulky process.
2. The API has some default values (example: question type) so creating the code around changing that default value or keeping it the same adds some complexity.
3. There are 24 categories, but user can't select 24; fixed.
4. Entering a 0 for question number choice will give you question 1; fixed.
5. Entering 51 for number of questions will give you no error even though there is a max of 50 questions; fixed.
6. If the user really wanted, they could select the same question over and over again; going to add a feature to drop the question from the set after it has been attempted.
