# Lab-4-Using-Web-APIs
This repository will house everything needed for CSCI 2910 Lab 4.

## Issues
1. Open Trivia Database API has 25 categories, so displaying category options to the user will be a bulky process.
2. The API has some default values (example: question type) so creating the code around changing that default value or keeping it the same adds some complexity.
3. There are 24 categories, but user can't select 24; fixed.
4. Entering a 0 for question number choice will give you question 1; fixed.
5. Entering 51 for number of questions will give you no error even though there is a max of 50 questions; fixed.
6. HTML elements in the question and answers display in an ugly manner, fixed with html module.
